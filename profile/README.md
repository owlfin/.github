# 🦉 Owlfin Finance

**Owlfin Finance** is a next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on transparency, sustainability, and long-term value creation — launching first on the **TON blockchain**.

We’re building a system where active participation, strategic trading, and consistent contribution are fairly rewarded — not just capital size.


## 🎯 Our Mission

To create a transparent, fair, and gamified financial platform where traders, stakers, and the broader community benefit together.


## 🛠️ What We’re Building

**Phase 1: Owlfin Arena (DEX on TON)**
- Session-based trading pools with USDT
- Real-time leaderboard and points system
- Performance-based token minting
- Weekly reward cycles and streak bonuses
- Stake-to-earn with burn-resistant mechanics

**Tokenomics Principles**
- Tokens are minted via activity, not sold
- Point-based minting ensures contribution-first economy
- Token utility includes staking, treasury share, and campaign access


## 🪙 Why TON?

We chose TON for its:
- Blazing-fast transaction speed
- Low fees for trading + staking logic
- Growing community and ecosystem tools
- Compatibility with Telegram-native user base

We aim to contribute to the TON ecosystem by showcasing what a well-designed, fair DeFi project can look like.


## 🧾 Our Smart Contract Repo

We believe in **verifiability** and **on-chain trust**.

This repo includes core logic for:
- SessionPool
- GlobalPool
- Treasury
- Token Minting + Burn


## 🪄 Grant Participation

We are preparing for the upcoming **TON Grant round** to accelerate Owlfin Arena’s development and roll out community campaigns backed by transparent on-chain logic.
